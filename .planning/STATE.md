# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-20)

**Core value:** A single level must feel arcade-punchy, skillful, and visually spectacular at a stable 60 FPS—responsive controls and accurate physics come first; neon effects never steal clarity or frame time.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — First Playable — Render, Input, Bricks, Lives, Pause

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (First Playable — Render, Input, Bricks, Lives, Pause) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 6
Status: Executing Phase 03
Last activity: 2026-09-20 -- Phase 03 execution started

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] ~25% (2/8 phases) (2/8 phases)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 10 (Phase 01: 4, Phase 02: 6)
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: —

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 4 | — | — |
| 02 | 6 | — | — |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Phase 1]: Simulator-only waiver for device gates; D-04/D-05 Pixel 6a + physical re-cert before MVP
- [Phase 1]: Skia 2.12.0 Confirmed; UI-thread worklet topology retained
- [Phase 2]: Classic Breakout paddle bounce; MAX_BALL_SPEED + 2× tunneling props; N-ball + event ring (1 active); multi-HP/unbreakable metadata
- [Phase 3]: Snappy relative-drag; tap serve no aim line; tap+3s countdown resume; navy flat render; hardcoded grid; gesture/UI separation

### Pending Todos

- Before MVP: Pixel 6a (or D-04) gfxinfo SC-3 + physical device SC-1/SC-2

### Blockers/Concerns

- [MVP] Hardware performance gates still open (waived only for Phase 1 close)

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Device gate | Android SC-1/SC-2 + SC-3 gfxinfo (Pixel 6a) | Open — before MVP (D-04) | 2026-09-20 |
| Device gate | iOS profiling SC-2 / physical re-check | Open — before MVP (D-05) | 2026-09-20 |
