# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-20)

**Core value:** A single level must feel arcade-punchy, skillful, and visually spectacular at a stable 60 FPS—responsive controls and accurate physics come first; neon effects never steal clarity or frame time.
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — run-rules-score-combo-power-ups-anti-stall

## Current Position

Phase: 05 (run-rules-score-combo-power-ups-anti-stall) — EXECUTING
Plan: 7 of 7
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-09-20

Progress: [████░░░░░░] ~50% (4/8 phases)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Phase 1]: Simulator-only waiver for device gates; D-04/D-05 Pixel 6a + physical re-cert before MVP
- [Phase 1]: Skia 2.12.0 Confirmed; UI-thread worklet topology retained
- [Phase 2]: Classic Breakout paddle bounce; MAX_BALL_SPEED + 2× tunneling props; N-ball + event ring (1 active); multi-HP/unbreakable metadata
- [Phase 3]: Snappy relative-drag; tap serve no aim line; tap+3s countdown resume; navy flat render; hardcoded grid; gesture/UI separation
- [Phase 04]: Wave 0: invalid fixtures + it.todo stubs; LVL reqs deferred to Plans 01–03
- [Phase 04]: Non-finite grid fixture uses originX:null (JSON has no Infinity/NaN)
- [Phase 04]: Prefer compile stub so loadAndCompile imports compileLevel; packing in 04-02
- [Phase 04]: brickTypes built on null-prototype map after rejecting dangerous keys
- [Phase 04]: level-02 mid-row steel corridor + side walls for fingerprint ≠ level-01
- [Phase 04]: applyCompiledLevel uses spatial when gridRows>1; packed 1-row fallback otherwise
- [Phase 04]: Inlined planBrickDamageCuesLocal in worklet (sync with damageCues.ts) to avoid JS remotes
- [Phase 04]: Stroke color #E5E7EB width 1.25; hatch = 3 fixed diagonals distinct from hp===1 cracks
- [Phase 05]: Wave 0: lives stubs-only until Plan 04; no applyLivesFromEvents
- [Phase 05]: hashWorld golden-replay Wave 0 box deferred to Plan 01
- [Phase 05]: Locked SCORE_HIT=10, DROP_CHANCE=0.2, EXPAND_DURATION_TICKS=1200, STALL_IDLE_TICKS=960 verbatim
- [Phase 05]: compactBallPool swaps SoA after CCD; activeBallCount is live dense count (D-12)
- [Phase 05]: hashWorld extended with score/combo/pickups/stall (T-05-01)
- [Phase 05]: Award-then-increment locked: score uses current combo before combo += 1
- [Phase 05]: Scoring barrel + stepRun wiring deferred to Plan 04 (Wave 2 ownership)
- [Phase 05]: Task order effects → multiball → pickups so catch can import helpers
- [Phase 05]: Even/odd SoA slot index signs ±18°/±36° multiball angles
- [Phase 05]: Power-up barrel export + stepRun deferred to Plan 04
- [Phase 05]: Deleted applyLivesFromEvents; life only when activeBallCount===0
- [Phase 05]: Life-reset sets combo=1; preserves score and brick HP
- [Phase 05]: stepRun PLAYING: score→drops→pickups→effects→lives→win (stall Plan 05)
- [Phase 05]: Apply ×1.08 speed once when entering tier 2; ±8° nudge once when entering tier 3
- [Phase 05]: stepRun integration uses sentinel breakable below paddle so win check does not WON on empty grid

### Pending Todos

- Before MVP: Pixel 6a (or D-04) gfxinfo SC-3 + physical device SC-1/SC-2

### Blockers/Concerns

- [MVP] Hardware performance gates still open (waived only for Phase 1 close)

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Device gate | Android SC-1/SC-2 + SC-3 gfxinfo (Pixel 6a) | Open — before MVP (D-04) | 2026-09-20 |
| Device gate | iOS profiling SC-2 / physical re-check | Open — before MVP (D-05) | 2026-09-20 |
